DI in the context of the spring framework is a design pattern and technique used to achieve loose coupling between components in a software application. 

In a DI scenario, instead of component creating its dependency directly, the dependency are injected into the component from an external source, typically managed by a framework like spring.


How to Inject dependencies?
- There are two ways:-
    - Constructor injection - using Constructor (recommended)
    - Field injection - using autowired annotation
