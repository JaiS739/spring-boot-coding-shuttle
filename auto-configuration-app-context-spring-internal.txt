What is Auto configuration?
- Auto configuration is a mechanism which automatically configures the spring application based on the  
dependencies present on the  classpath and other application-specific settings.

    This feature simplifies the set up and development process, allowing developers to focus more on  writing business logic rather than configuring the framework.

What is classpath?
-   It is a list of directories and JAR files that the JVM needed to look up classes your program needs.


🔹 What is a JAR file in Java?

JAR = Java ARchive

It’s basically a compressed file (like a .zip) that bundles together:

.class files (compiled bytecode)

resources (images, properties files, XML, etc.)

metadata (like MANIFEST.MF)

👉 Think of it as a container for a Java library or application.

🔹 Why use JAR files?

Packaging → Instead of distributing hundreds of .class files, you put them all in one JAR.

Reusability → You can import a JAR into another project as a library.

Portability → A JAR works on any system with JVM.

Execution → Some JARs are “executable JARs” (you can run them directly with java -jar).

POM - Project Object Model


What is a Bean?
 - A Spring bean is a Java object that lives inside the Spring container and whose lifecycle (creation, dependency injection, destruction) is managed by Spring, not by you.


What is IOC?
 - The IoC Container in Spring is a framework component that creates, configures, and manages the lifecycle of objects (beans) and injects dependencies into them.
